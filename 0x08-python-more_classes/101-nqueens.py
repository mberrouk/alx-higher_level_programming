Module: The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens
on an NÃ—N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

    Usage: nqueens N
        - If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
        print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the
        status 1
    Where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4:
        - If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a
        new line, and exit with the status 1
        - If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by
        a new line, and exit with the status 1
    The program should print every possible solution to the problem:
        - One solution per line
